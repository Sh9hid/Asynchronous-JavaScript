# Asynchronous JavaScript: Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await

This repository demonstrates three approaches to handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript: **callbacks**, **Promises**, and **async/await**. Each method is implemented in a simple data-fetching example with error handling and timeout functionality.

## Theoretical Overview

### Callbacks
**What they are**:  
Callbacks are those functions which are passed as arguments to another function and are executed when a particular task is completed.


## 1. **Callbacks-Based Implementation**  
**File**: `callbacks.js`  
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback('Data fetched');
    }, 1000);
}

fetchData((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Data fetched
});
```

**Key traits**:
- Foundational to JavaScriptâ€™s async model (e.g., `setTimeout`).
- Prone to "callback hell" (deep nesting).
- Manual error handling via `if (err)` checks.

**Advantages of Callbacks**

- They are very simple to use and are widely supported.
- Efficient when working with simple asynchronous operations.

**Disadvantages of Callbacks**

- Quite complicated when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations which leads to callback hell.
- Error handling is challenging task as the code becomes complicated and hard to understand.

### Promises

**What they are**:  
Promises is a representation of completion or failure of any asynchronous operation. It allows chaining of multiple asynchronous operations. There are basically 3 states in promises i.e., resolve, pending and reject.



## 2. **Promise-Based Implementation**  
**File**: `promise.js`  
```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data fetched');
        }, 1000);
    });
}

fetchData()
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result); // Output: Data fetched
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

**Key traits**:
- Chainable with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- Avoid callback nesting.
- Built-in error propagation.

**Chaining Promise:**
```javascript
fetchData()
    .then((result) => {
        return processData(result);
    })
    .then((processedData) => {
        console.log(processedData);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
 ```   
In the above code, fetchData() function is either resolved or rejected. If the request is resolved, .then will be executed step-by-step. But is the request is rejected then the chain will be executed till it reaches the .catch block to display the error.

**Advantages of Promises**

- Promises solves the main problem of callback hell by providing chaining. This makes code more readable and clean.
- Error handling is improved with the help of promises as we can use .catch() for error handling in promises.

**Disadvantages of Promises**

- Requires deep understanding of Promises API as it includes multiple properties and methods.

### Async/Await
**What it is**:  
Async/await is a feature that is built on top of promises to make it better and efficient. It is more concise and provides a synchronous-like way to write asynchronous programs. await keyword is always used inside the async function scope.

Syntactic sugar over Promises for writing async code in a synchronous style.  



## 3. **Async-Await-Based Implementation**  
**File**: `async-await.js`  
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data fetched');
        }, 1000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
    try {
        const result = await fetchData();
        console.log(result); // Output: Data fetched
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();
```

**Key traits**:
- Uses `async` functions and `await` keywords.
- Errors handled with `try/catch`.
- Cleaner and more readable for sequential operations.


**Advantages of Async/Await**

- It is much more readable as compared to promises and callbacks. It is much alike synchronous code which is easier to understand.
- It is built on top of the promises which provides compatibility between the two.

**Disadvantages of Async/Await**

- It has limited support in the older versions.

### **Comparison**
- **Performance:**
As we compare, promises and async/await is slightly overhead as compared to callbacks because of the abstraction layer. But the difference is as good as null.
- **Readability and Maintainability:**
Async/await provides the most readable and maintainable code and followed by promises but callbacks leads to callback hell.
- **Error Handling:**
Async/await provides the best error handling syntax which provides much cleaner code. It is followed by promises and callbacks are mostly prone to errors.
Sequential vs. Parallel Operations: All the three approaches provides both the sequential and parallel operations. Async/await and promises provides clean and maintainable syntax for sequential operations.

### **Best Practices and Use Cases**
- **When to Use Callbacks:** Use callbacks either for simple and easy asynchronous operations or when handling those APIs that only support callbacks.
- **When to Use Promises:** Promises are well suitable for handling multiple asynchronous operations in a more structured manner using .then.
- **When to Use Async/Await:** Use Async/Await for writing clean and much readable asynchronous code, especially for complex tasks involving multiple asynchronous operations.

### **Migration and Adoption**

- **Migrating from Callbacks to Promises:** Rewrite callback-based code to use Promises for improved readability and error handling.
- **Migrating from Promises to Async/Await:** Convert Promises to Async/Await for even cleaner and more synchronous-like code.
**Conclusion**
Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await provides us different approaches towards handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. While callbacks are simple but prone to callback hell, Promises and Async/Await provide cleaner and more readable code structures. Choosing the right approach depends on the specific requirements and complexity of the asynchronous task
